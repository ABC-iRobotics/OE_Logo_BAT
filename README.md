## Usage
In order to use the code you need to install [Blender 2.9](https://www.blender.org/) and you need to install the [BAT](https://github.com/ABC-iRobotics/blender_annotation_tool) (Blender Annotation Tool) addon inside Blender.

## Render frames
The render_frames.py module can be used to make photo realistic renders and rendered masks of the scene in oe_logo_demo.blend.

## Images to YOLO format
The images_to_yolo_format.py module can be used to convert rendered masks to YOLO format and create annotation files which contains bounding boxes.
